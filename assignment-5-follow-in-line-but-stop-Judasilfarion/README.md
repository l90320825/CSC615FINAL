# CSC615-Follow in Line but Stop

You will read (i.e. input) from the two sensors, one should be able to tell you if you are over Black or over White (i.e. on the line or off the line) and the other sensor will state if there is an obstruction in front of the sensor.  You should do this with threads and a main loop that checks the values.
