# CSC615-Speed Encoder

This is the second of a two-part assignment. In this, the second part, you will use the wheel encoders to validate the speed that each wheel is running, in cm/sec.  The purpose is to allow proper speed control in real world conditions where the same power may not yield consistent speed results.

See the PDF in the repository here (or iLearn for more details).
