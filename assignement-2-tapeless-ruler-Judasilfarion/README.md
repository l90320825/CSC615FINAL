# CSC615-Tapeless-Ruler

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.  You can (and should) work in groups to research how to do the assignment, but each person should code their own version and make their own submission.

This is a physical class, so I will want to see what you do in action.  Documentation, including short video clips (can use your cell phone) are required as part of the submission.  It might be handy to have a friend record while you execute your program.

You will also need to submit hardware drawings.  These should be neat (can be either electronic or hand drawn, then scanned) of how the hardware is connected to the Raspberry Pi.  This includes which pin (physical and GPIO), positive and negative flow, resisters, etc.  I should be able to rebuild your setup from this diagram and then run your program and get the same results.  Also see https://www.circuit-diagram.org/editor/# if you want to use that (they have a Raspberry Pi template).

## Assignment Description

1.	Read the following page “Component Knowledge”.

2.	You are going to measure distance using the Echo Sensor (HC-SR04).  You are to display distance in centimeters in your terminal.  Make sure to show the object moving and the distance on the console when you do your video.

3.	You are to connect the sensor to the ultrasonic pins on the Motor Shield for hardware mangers.  See the motor shield specifications on iLearn to determine the pins and the pin numbers.  For the rest of you select two GPIO pins on the pi to connect the Trigger and Echo pins.

4.	Submit your homework in your GitHub Repository and the PDF on iLearn per the submission details below.
